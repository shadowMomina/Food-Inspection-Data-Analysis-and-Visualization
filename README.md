# Food Inspection Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data analysis project using Python. The project focuses on a food inspection dataset and demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data effectively.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to transform messy, raw data into a structured and visually understandable format. The notebook includes data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Import and manage datasets directly from local files.
- Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Perform column renaming and type conversions.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Generate multiple visualizations and automatically save them as image files.
- Include both the **cleaned dataset** and **visual outputs** for reference.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Food_Inspection_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` — main code file containing all operations  
- `cleaned_food_inspection_data.csv` — final cleaned dataset  
- `visuals/` — folder containing all saved figures and charts  
- `README.md` — project overview and instructions

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Food_Inspection_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization.git
````

2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Upload your dataset file when prompted.
4. Run all cells to clean the data and generate visualizations.

## 📈 Outcome

This project provides a clean and readable dataset, detailed data insights, and ready-to-use visual representations — all in one place.
It’s a great addition to any portfolio to showcase **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills**.
